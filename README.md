#### Instructions

1. Make sure you are using a version of notebook greater than v.3. If you installed Anaconda with python 3 - this is likely to be fine. The next piece of code will check if you have the right version.
2. The notebook has both some open test cases that you can use to test the functionality of your code - however it will be run on another set of test cases that you can't from which marks will be awarded. So passing all the tests in this notebook is not a guarantee that you have done things correctly - though its highly probable.
3. Also make sure you submit a notebook that doesn't return any errors. One way to ensure this is to run all the cells before you submit the notebook.
4. When you are done create a zip file of your notebook and upload that
5. For each cell where you see "YOUR CODE HERE" delete the return notImplemented statement when you write your code there - don't leave it in the notebook.
6. Once you are done, you are done.
